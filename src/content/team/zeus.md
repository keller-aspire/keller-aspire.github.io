## Our Leader

Zeus leads our organization with the same commanding presence he brings to Mount Olympus. With expertise in strategic leadership and divine intervention, he oversees all major decisions and ensures our success with thunderous determination.

### Early Life

Zeus was the son of Cronus and Rhea. He was the youngest of his siblings, and the only one who was not swallowed by his father. He was also the only one who was not castrated by his father.
